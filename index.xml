      <description>The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such aroom would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal.

      <description>Hyper-Reality is a short film created by Keiichi Matsuda. It presents a dystopian and provocative vision of future, where Mixed Reality is used daily.

The products appear differently depending on who you are, in order to sell more.
Possible scenarios We could imagine a lot of other scenarios in which Mixed Reality technology can create problems for the user or can be abused by content creators, authorities, users or other entities.</description>
