      <description>Hyper-Reality is a short film created by Keiichi Matsuda. It presents a dystopian and provocative vision of future, where Mixed Reality is used daily. Because of this, advertising is pervasive. Signs are added everywhere. Reality is modified to appear more attractive, like this supermarket which appears more stocked than in reality. The products appear differently depending on who you are, in order to sell more.
Possible scenarios We could imagine a lot of other scenarios in which Mixed Reality technology can create problems for the user or can be abused by content creators, authorities, users or other entities.</description>
